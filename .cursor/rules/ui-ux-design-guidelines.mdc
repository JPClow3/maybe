Use the rules below when:

- You are writing HTML templates
- You are writing CSS
- You are writing styles in Django templates

## Rules for AI (mandatory)

The codebase uses TailwindCSS v3.4+ with a custom design system built via PostCSS.

- Always start by referencing the Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) and custom CSS files in `maybe_django/static/css/input.css` to see the base primitives, functional tokens, and component tokens we use in the codebase
- The compiled CSS is generated from `maybe_django/static/css/input.css` to `maybe_django/static/css/main.css` using `npm run css:build`
- Always prefer using functional "tokens" and component classes defined in the design system when possible.
  - Example 1: use `text-primary-600` or `text-primary` (component class) rather than `text-blue-500`
  - Example 2: use `card` (component class) rather than `bg-white shadow rounded-lg p-6`
  - Example 3: use `btn-primary` (component class) rather than `bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded`
  - Example 4: use `form-input`, `form-select`, `form-textarea` (component classes) for form fields
- Design tokens are defined in `maybe_django/static/css/input.css` using Tailwind's `@layer components`
- Never create new styles in design system files without explicitly receiving permission to do so
- Always generate semantic HTML
- Use design token classes: `text-primary`, `text-success`, `text-danger`, `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-danger`, `card`, `form-input`, etc.
