# General rules for AI 

- Use `request.user` for the current user in views and templates. Do NOT use `current_user`.
- Prior to generating any code, carefully read the project conventions and guidelines
  - Read [project-design.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-design.mdc) to understand the codebase
  - Read [project-conventions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc) to understand _how_ to write code for the codebase
  - Read [ui-ux-design-guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ui-ux-design-guidelines.mdc) to understand how to implement frontend code specifically
  - Read [stimulus_conventions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/stimulus_conventions.mdc) for HTMX patterns
- Ignore i18n methods and files. Hardcode strings in English for now to optimize speed of development.
- Always use design system component classes (`btn-primary`, `card`, `form-input`, etc.) from the design system defined in `maybe_django/static/css/input.css`
- When modifying CSS, update `maybe_django/static/css/input.css` and run `npm run css:build` to compile

## Prohibited actions

- Do not run `python manage.py runserver` in your responses.
- Do not automatically run migrations
- Do not run `python manage.py createsuperuser` in your responses
- Do not modify `maybe_django/static/css/main.css` directly - it is generated from `input.css`
